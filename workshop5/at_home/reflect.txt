1. a copy of the object is not made thus making the program less expensive and more efficient
by using less resources.
2. because an operator function already exists but when we define it for fraction and integer
we are overloading the pre-existing function for that specific instance. 
3. i have learned how to properly cast integers to yield propper results. i have learned
how to properly implement operators and int operators. a deeper understanding of operators and how to
manipulate them to my advantage.
