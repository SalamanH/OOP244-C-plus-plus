1. 
 an empty state it meant for validation, prior to accepting the data, we can check
if its valid or not. and if the data is not valid we set it to a safe empty state. strings
are set to equal NULL and integers are set to equal 0, a value but an empty value. 

2. 
in the case of having clients with different values, and different number of parameters,
you could use different constructors to initialize these different clients and simplify the
code instead of having it all in the cpp file. 

3. this workshop was straight forward other than the travelWith member function that had 
the array being passed to it. finding out how to use the array was the most difficult part.
Next to that was using the display function to display different text when it was called 
at different times. this made me take advantage of the boolean and thus add more default 
parameters to properly code the function.
